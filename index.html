              <p>On December 23rd 1962 I was born in San Antonio Texas at Santa Rosa Hospital one month early. The youngest of 6 I'm always reminded that that was the best Christmas my 2 brothers and 
              3 sisters have ever had, gift wise that is. Apparently my father cleaned out JC Penney that year. Another part of that story that is told is that I had a police escort due to my
              father speeding. From that point moving forward we moved to El Paso Texas a year later. My dad thought it would be better to work on electrical equipment in Ft Bliss then checking
              for radiation leaks in a warehouse full of nuclear weapons. I think that is where I got the passion to take things apart and see how they tick. There was lots that didn't quite make it
              to there original condition. I have mainly since that time have only had 3 jobs. After a brief stint with the Air Force I went to a electronic tech school in Austin. I started with a 
              company in 1985 called Multigraphics a division of AM International working on printing equipment like presses, paper cutters, booklet makers etc. In 1995 I went to work for a german company 
              called Heidelberg. They are the largest printing manufacturer in the world and owning one is a big deal. They can sell for millions of dollars each. It seems like 9/11 changed everything.
              The 2008 recession took a big toll in the printing industry, along with many others. in 2012 I was let go and started IndependentPress LLC. My middle son Daniel helped and we were able 
              to travel the county and Caribbean together, Honduras, Trinidad/Tabago, St Lucia(our favorite) St Maartin and in Cannada, St Johns, to name a few. Having said all this, last year he took a coding 
              bootcamp and is now working in the coding world. That peaked my interest and decided to enroll in a bootcamp myself to advance my career in a new direction, in what will be around fo a long time.</p>
